//! Heuristic detection of horizontal "text bands" in the captured
//! screenshot. Used by the Highlighter tool to snap freehand strokes
//! to the bounds of underlying text lines (the "smart" highlighter
//! mode), and to render a hover preview that hints at the band the
//! cursor is over.
//!
//! Why a heuristic and not OCR: macOS apps can lean on Apple's Vision
//! framework — a system-provided text recognizer with no analogue on
//! wlroots/Linux. Bundling Tesseract would add a heavy native dependency
//! and noticeable startup latency. The heuristic below is essentially
//! free (one O(w·h) pass at app init), works on the common text-on-light
//! and text-on-dark layouts we care about, and degrades gracefully — when
//! the heuristic fails (icons, photos) the user gets the regular
//! free-form highlighter behavior.
//!
//! The detector runs once at app start and the result is cached
//! globally via `OnceLock`. The Highlighter tool reads from the
//! cache; no per-frame cost.
//!
//! Algorithm: per-row horizontal edge density. For each row we count
//! the number of sampled positions where `|lum(x) - lum(x+STRIDE)|`
//! exceeds `EDGE_DELTA` — i.e. horizontal brightness transitions.
//! Text rows have many such transitions (glyph edges); solid-
//! background rows have ~0. Crucially this is invariant to the row's
//! absolute background color, which makes the heuristic work on UI
//! screenshots whose rows span multiple background regions (dialog
//! backdrop + button surface + accent button) — where the
//! row-mean-based approach used to fail because no single mean
//! described "the background" for the row.
//!
//! Vertically dilate the per-row "is-text" signal by
//! `VERTICAL_MERGE_GAP` to bridge intra-line gaps (between ascender
//! and x-height body, around bowls of `e`/`a`/`o`, antialiased ramp
//! rows that fall below threshold), then group contiguous-true
//! regions into bands. Filter by height to drop obvious non-text
//! (single horizontal rules, multi-row blocks of solid color, etc.).
