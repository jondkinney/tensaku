//! Custom drawing-tool cursors. Both Brush and Highlighter use a
//! "double ring" cursor (dark outer, light inner) so the cursor stays
//! readable on any background — same reasoning as Mac apps using a
//! drawing cursors.
//!
//! - Brush: circular, diameter = stroke line width. Tells the user
//!   exactly how thick the next pen stroke will be.
//! - Highlighter: vertical capsule (chisel tip) whose outer height —
//!   the top of one rounded cap to the top of the other — equals the
//!   width of the highlight stripe that gets laid down. The cursor's
//!   width is a thin marker-tip value so it still reads as a chisel
//!   rather than a fat capsule.
//!
//! On HiDPI displays, GTK4 paints cursor textures at a larger
//! on-screen size than their texture pixel count would suggest, so the
//! cursor builders divide by DPR to compensate — without this, a
//! 30 px highlight stroke rendered at 2x DPR drew at 30 CSS px on
//! screen while the cursor texture (30 px) showed at 60 CSS px, and
//! the highlight came out at ~60 % of the cursor.
//!
//! Cursors are recreated whenever the relevant style inputs change
//! (size, annotation_size_factor); neither cursor encodes color, so
//! changing the picker color does not require regeneration.
