# <img src="assets/tensaku.svg" height="42"> Tensaku: Modern Screenshot Annotation.

Tensaku is a screenshot annotation tool inspired by [Swappy](https://github.com/jtheoof/swappy) and [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/).

> **Tensaku is a fork of [Satty](https://github.com/Satty-org/Satty)** by Matthias Gabriel, used under the MPL-2.0 license. See [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) for attribution details — thanks to the Satty project and its contributors for the foundation this builds on.

![A screenshot annotated in Tensaku — arrows, colored text callouts, numbered markers, a highlight box, and a redaction blur](assets/annotation-example.png)

Tensaku provides:

- a simple, easy-to-understand toolset (like Swappy)
- fullscreen annotation mode and post-shot cropping (like Flameshot)
- extremely smooth rendering thanks to HW acceleration (OpenGL)
- support for wlroots-based compositors (Sway, Hyprland, River, ...)
- a minimal, modern-looking UI, thanks to GTK and Adwaita

## What Tensaku adds

Tensaku extends Satty with a number of new capabilities:

- **Movable annotations** — select, move, resize, multi-select, duplicate, and delete annotations *after* drawing them with the Pointer tool. The Arrow tool also gains Standard, Pointy, Curved, and Double styles.
- **Scrolling screenshots** — capture content taller than the screen. `tensaku --scroll-capture` opens a fullscreen overlay; drag-select a region, then capture by manual or automatic scrolling, and the frames are stitched into one tall image on the annotation canvas.
- **Layers panel** — treat annotations as layers you can reorder, lock, hide, rename, and drag-and-drop. Toggle it with <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd>.
- **Paste images** — <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> drops a clipboard image onto the canvas as a resizable layer.
- **Spotlight tool** — dim the screenshot everywhere except the regions you highlight.
- **Redaction-grade blur** — the Blur tool adds irreversible *Secure Blur* and *Black Out* styles alongside Gaussian and Pixelate.
- **Zoom** — zoom the canvas with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+scroll or the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+digit shortcuts, with an on-screen zoom indicator.
- **Reworked crop** — aspect-ratio presets, exact width/height entry, rotate and flip, a background-color matte, and pan/zoom while cropping.
- **Reworked color picker** — a swatch grid with drag-to-reorder custom colors that persist across launches.
- **Preferences dialog** — open with <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd> to rebind tool shortcuts and toggle behaviors; choices persist to a state file kept separate from `config.toml`.

## Install

### Arch Linux (AUR)

Tensaku is published on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tensaku):

```sh
yay -S tensaku   # or: paru -S tensaku
```

### cargo

```sh
cargo install tensaku
tensaku --install-desktop   # add the icon + desktop entry
```

This builds from source, so it needs a Rust toolchain and the GTK-4 / Adwaita native dependencies — see [Dependencies](#dependencies). `cargo install` places only the binary; `tensaku --install-desktop` then registers the icon and `.desktop` entry under `~/.local/share/` (launcher icon, file associations) — the AUR package and `make install` do this already.

### Pre-built binary and Flatpak

Each [GitHub release](https://github.com/jondkinney/tensaku/releases) attaches an x86-64 Linux tarball and a Flatpak bundle:

```sh
flatpak install tensaku-<version>.flatpak
```

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jondkinney/tensaku.git
cd tensaku
make build-release              # binary at ./target/release/tensaku
PREFIX=/usr/local make install  # optional: install system-wide
```

See [Dependencies](#dependencies) and [Build from source](#build-from-source) for the full dependency list and uninstall instructions.

## Usage

Start by providing a filename or a screenshot via stdin (or use `--scroll-capture`, below) and annotate using the available tools. Save to clipboard or file when finished. Tools and interface have been kept simple.

Tensaku reads its settings from three places:

- **`config.toml`** — a config file you edit by hand, at `~/.config/tensaku/config.toml` (see [Configuration File](#configuration-file)). Tensaku never writes to it.
- **Command-line flags** — override `config.toml` for a single run (see [Command Line](#command-line)).
- **The Preferences dialog** — in-app settings and tool-shortcut edits (see [Preferences Dialog](#preferences-dialog)). These persist to a *separate* state file (`~/.local/state/tensaku/state.toml`) and are applied on top of `config.toml` — so a shortcut or toggle you change in Preferences wins over `config.toml`, and `config.toml` itself is left untouched.

### Shortcuts

- <kbd>Enter</kbd>: as configured (see below), default: copy-to-clipboard (may be masked by active tool)
- <kbd>Esc</kbd>: as configured (see below), default: exit (may be masked by active tool)
- <kbd>Delete</kbd> reset (clear) <sup>experimental</sup> <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>: Save to clipboard (may be masked by active tool)
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+D</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd>: Open GTK inspector if not already opened
- <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd>: Save to specified output file
- <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+S</kbd>: Save using file dialog <sup>0.20.0</sup>. The dialog uses `output-filename` as initial filename/path when available and remembers the last selected folder. <sup>0.21.0</sup>
- <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+C</kbd>: Copy last saved filepath to clipboard <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- <kbd>Ctrl+T</kbd>: Toggle toolbars
- <kbd>Ctrl+L</kbd>: Toggle the layers panel (configurable — see `layer-panel-shortcut`)
- <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd>: Open Preferences
- <kbd>Ctrl+Y</kbd>: Redo
- <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd>: Undo
- <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd>: Delete the selected annotation(s) — same as <kbd>Delete</kbd>, but reachable with the left hand
- <kbd>Alt+D</kbd>: Duplicate the selected annotation(s)
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+scroll, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>+</kbd>/<kbd>-</kbd>: Zoom the canvas in/out
- <kbd>Ctrl+0</kbd>: Reset zoom to 100%; <kbd>Ctrl+1</kbd>: fit to window; <kbd>Ctrl+2</kbd>–<kbd>5</kbd>: zoom to 200–500%; <kbd>Ctrl+9</kbd>: zoom to 50%
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+(<kbd>Left</kbd>/<kbd>Right</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd>/<kbd>Down</kbd>): Pan, also available with middle mouse button drag <sup>0.20.1</sup>

#### Color Selection Shortcuts <sup>0.20.1</sup>

<kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>, …, <kbd>9</kbd>, <kbd>0</kbd> — select nth color from the color palette

#### Tool Selection Shortcuts (configurable) <sup>0.20.0</sup>
Default single-key shortcuts:
- <kbd>v</kbd>: Pointer tool
- <kbd>x</kbd>: Crop tool
- <kbd>z</kbd>: Brush tool
- <kbd>s</kbd>: Line tool
- <kbd>a</kbd>: Arrow tool
- <kbd>r</kbd>: Rectangle tool
- <kbd>e</kbd>: Ellipse tool
- <kbd>t</kbd>: Text tool
- <kbd>c</kbd>: Numbered Marker tool
- <kbd>b</kbd>: Blur tool
- <kbd>w</kbd>: Highlighter tool
- <kbd>g</kbd>: Spotlight tool

These defaults all sit on the **left half of a QWERTY keyboard** by design — you can switch tools one-handed while your right hand stays on the mouse. That makes Tensaku comfortable to drive on split keyboards and for left-hand-only use, and it's why the duplicate / delete chords are <kbd>Alt+D</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> rather than keys on the far side of the board.

Shortcuts can be rebound either in the `[keybinds]` section of `config.toml` (see below) or, more conveniently, in the [Preferences dialog](#preferences-dialog) (<kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd>). Each binding is a single character.

### Tool Modifiers and Keys

- Pointer: Click an annotation to select it, drag to move it, and drag a handle to resize it (hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> on a corner handle to keep the aspect ratio, or on a side handle to resize symmetrically about the center). Multiple annotations can be selected and moved together; <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd> selects all and arrow keys nudge the selection.
- Arrow: Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to make arrow snap to 15° steps
- Ellipse: Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> to center the ellipse around origin, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> for a circle
- Highlight: Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to snap segments to 15° steps. The Highlighter has two styles — freehand, and a "smart" mode that snaps to lines of text — switched from the toolbar's style menu or by double-tapping <kbd>w</kbd>.
- Line: Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to make line snap to 15° steps
- Rectangle: Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> to center the rectangle around origin, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> for a square
- Text:
  - Press <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd> to insert line break.
  - Combine <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Right</kbd> for word jump or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> for word delete.
  - Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or switch to another tool to accept input, press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to discard entered text.
  - <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> go to the start/end of current line or previous/next line if already on first/last character of line (automatic wrapping is not considered for this). <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>Home</kbd>/<kbd>End</kbd> jumps to start/end of text buffer.
  - <kbd>Up</kbd> or <kbd>Down</kbd> to jump to previous/next line (if already on first/last line, it jumps to the start/end of text buffer). <sup>0.20.1</sup>
  - Combine <kbd>Shift</kbd> with other keys to select text (e.g. `Shift+Home` to select from start of line to cursor,  <kbd>Shift+Left</kbd> to select characters before cursor,  <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Left</kbd> to select words before cursor,and so on) <sup>0.20.1</sup>
  - <kbd>Double-click </kbd> to select word under cursor.Triple-click to select all text. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
  - <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd> to select all text. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
  - <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to copy selected text to clipboard. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
  - <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> to cut selected text to clipboard. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
  - <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> to paste text from clipboard. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
  - <kbd>Alt+Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Right</kbd> or <kbd>Up</kbd> or <kbd>Down</kbd> to move the text. Use <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+Shift</kbd> with arrow keys to nudge the text. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- Crop:
   - Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> or right mouse button while editing to reset crop altogether <sup>0.21.0</sup>
   - Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> while editing to finish editing crop and keep the crop area active <sup>0.21.0</sup>
   - Left click crop area when tool is active but not editing to resume editing<sup>0.21.0</sup>

### Preferences Dialog

Open the Preferences dialog with <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd> or the gear button in the top toolbar. It has two parts:

- **Keyboard Shortcuts** — a recorder row for every tool, Spotlight included. Click a row, press a key, then <kbd>Save</kbd> to commit (or <kbd>Cancel</kbd> to discard).
- **Behavior** — settings that apply immediately: the annotation size factor, invert scrolling direction, close window on Esc, close window on copy, close window on save, hide the default palette colors, and keep in-session tool adjustments across tool switches.

Everything set here is written to `~/.local/state/tensaku/state.toml` — **not** to `config.toml`. State is applied on top of `config.toml`, so a value changed in Preferences overrides the same setting in `config.toml`, and `config.toml` itself is never modified. Tensaku also records other remembered state in this file: the last-used color, saved custom colors, per-tool "save as default" sizes and fill states, and the last arrow / blur / highlighter style.

### Command Line

```
» tensaku --help
Modern Screenshot Annotation.

Usage: tensaku [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --man
          Show manpage. Pipe to man -l -
      --license
          Show license
      --install-desktop
          Install the desktop entry and app icon into the user's XDG data directory (~/.local/share), then exit. Run this once after `cargo install tensaku`; package installs (AUR, make install) register these files already
      --doctor
          Report whether the optional external tools Tensaku relies on (grim, slurp, wl-copy) are installed and the session looks right, then exit
      --install-omarchy-wrapper
          Install the Omarchy screenshot wrapper (~/.local/bin/tensaku-edit) so Omarchy's screenshot keybinds open captures in Tensaku, then exit. Also checks that OMARCHY_SCREENSHOT_EDITOR points at it
      --wire-omarchy
          Point Omarchy's screenshot editor at the tensaku-edit wrapper (sets OMARCHY_SCREENSHOT_EDITOR in ~/.config/hypr/envs.conf and the running session) and add float + center window rules for Tensaku, then exit. Installs the wrapper first if needed; does not edit keybinds
  -c, --config <CONFIG>
          Path to the config file. Otherwise will be read from XDG_CONFIG_DIR/tensaku/config.toml
  -f, --filename <FILENAME>
          Path to input image or '-' to read from stdin
      --auto-scroll-test
          Dev-only smoke test for the xdg-desktop-portal RemoteDesktop / libei handshake used by Auto-Scroll. Opens a portal session, requests pointer capability, reads back the EIS file descriptor, and exits
      --scroll-capture
          Enter scrolling-screenshot capture mode: opens a fullscreen overlay, drag to select a region, then capture by manual scroll or auto-scroll
      --scroll-capture-test <FULL|X,Y,W,H>
          Dev-only smoke test for the scrolling-screenshot capture pipeline. `FULL` captures the whole focused output; `x,y,w,h` captures a region. The captured frame is fed into tensaku's normal annotation canvas
      --fullscreen [<FULLSCREEN>]
          Start Tensaku in fullscreen mode. Since 0.20.1, takes optional parameter. --fullscreen without parameter is equivalent to --fullscreen current. Mileage may vary depending on compositor [possible values: all, current-screen]
      --resize [<MODE|WIDTHxHEIGHT>]
          Resize to coordinates or use smart mode (0.20.1). --resize without parameter is equivalent to --resize smart [possible values: smart, WxH.]
      --floating-hack
          Try to enforce floating (0.20.1). Mileage may vary depending on compositor
  -o, --output-filename <OUTPUT_FILENAME>
          Filename to use for saving action or '-' to print to stdout. Omit to disable saving to file. Might contain format specifiers: <https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html>. Since 0.20.0, can contain tilde (~) for home dir
      --early-exit
          Exit directly after copy/save action. 0.20.1: This does not apply to "save as"
      --early-exit-save-as
          Experimental (0.20.1): Exit directly after save as
      --corner-roundness <CORNER_ROUNDNESS>
          Draw corners of rectangles round if the value is greater than 0 (Defaults to 12) (0 disables rounded corners)
      --initial-tool <TOOL>
          Select the tool on startup [aliases: --init-tool] [possible values: pointer, crop, line, arrow, rectangle, ellipse, text, marker, blur, highlight, brush]
      --copy-command <COPY_COMMAND>
          Configure the command to be called on copy, for example `wl-copy`
      --annotation-size-factor <ANNOTATION_SIZE_FACTOR>
          Increase or decrease the size of the annotations
      --save-after-copy
          After copying the screenshot, save it to a file as well Preferably use the `action_on_copy` option instead
      --auto-copy

### CSS

Tensaku ships with [minimal builtin CSS](https://github.com/jondkinney/tensaku/tree/main/src/assets/default.css) which can be overridden by `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tensaku/overrides.css`. Adwaita defaults for headerbar (`@headerbar_fg_color` and `@headerbar_bg_color`) which Tensaku uses <sup>0.21.0</sup> may lack transparency, here's an override example:

```css
.outer_box,
.toolbar {
    color: #000000;
    background-color: #ddddddaa;
}
```

You can discover styleable elements by using the GTK inspector with env variable `GTK_DEBUG=interactive`.

### IME <sup>0.20.0</sup>

Tensaku supports IME via GTK with and without preediting. Please note, at this point Tensaku has no proper fallback font handling so the font used needs to contain the entered glyphs.

### Omarchy

Omarchy already ships screenshot keybinds — they run
`omarchy-capture-screenshot`, which handles the region/window selection
and hands the capture to whatever `OMARCHY_SCREENSHOT_EDITOR` points at.
Tensaku takes its input as a flag, not a positional argument, so it needs
a small wrapper (`~/.local/bin/tensaku-edit`) to bridge the two — and
Tensaku manages that wrapper for you. It's installed automatically the
first time Tensaku runs on an Omarchy session.

To wire everything up in one step:

```sh
tensaku --wire-omarchy
```

This installs the wrapper if needed and points `OMARCHY_SCREENSHOT_EDITOR`
at it — both in `~/.config/hypr/envs.conf` (persisted, and backed up first)
and in the running Hyprland session, so your screenshot keys open each
capture straight into Tensaku, with Omarchy's window/output highlighting
intact and no restart needed. `tensaku --install-omarchy-wrapper` installs
just the wrapper without touching any config, and `tensaku --doctor` shows
the current wrapper and wiring status.

**Scrolling capture** is a separate mode — `omarchy-capture-screenshot`
doesn't cover it. Bind a key straight to `tensaku --scroll-capture`,
alongside the screenshot binds in `~/.config/hypr/bindings.conf` — for
example an Alt variant of your screenshot key:

```
bindd = ALT, <your screenshot key>, Scrolling screenshot, exec, tensaku --scroll-capture --copy-command wl-copy --actions-on-enter save-to-clipboard
```

### Other wlroots compositors (Sway, Hyprland, river, …)

Not on Omarchy? Bind a key to a `grim` + `slurp` pipeline yourself:

```sh
grim -g "$(slurp -c '#ff0000ff')" -t ppm - | tensaku --filename - --fullscreen --output-filename ~/Pictures/Screenshots/tensaku-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S').png
```

Hyprland users must escape the `#` with another `#`:

```sh
grim -g "$(slurp -c '##ff0000ff')" -t ppm - | tensaku --filename - --fullscreen --output-filename ~/Pictures/Screenshots/tensaku-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S').png
```

`slurp` is a region picker — **drag a box** to select. A plain click
selects nothing and the pipeline aborts with `selection cancelled`.
`slurp` doesn't highlight windows on its own; for window/output
snapping, pipe it the rectangles (see the Sway example below) or use a
wrapper such as `grimblast` or `hyprshot`.

`tensaku --doctor` reports whether `grim`, `slurp`, and `wl-copy` are
installed — a quick way to confirm the screenshot pipeline is complete.

Please note we're using ppm in both examples. Compared to png, ppm is uncompressed and this can save time.

### Other examples

#### Image Resize

Tensaku can resample the whole screenshot from the Crop tool (<kbd>x</kbd>): open the **Image size** control in the crop toolbar, enter a new width or height — with an optional aspect-ratio lock — and click **Resize**. The image is rescaled with bilinear interpolation.

For scripted or headless workflows you can also resize by piping the output through a tool such as ImageMagick:

```sh
grim -g "0,0 3840x2160" -t ppm - | tensaku --filename - --output-filename - | convert -resize 50% - out.png
```

#### Sway mode

Add this to your ~/.config/sway/config.
It needs `grim` and `slurp`.
```sh

    bindsym r exec swaymsg 'mode "default"' && grim -t ppm -g "$(slurp -d)" - | $tensaku

    bindsym w exec swaymsg 'mode "default"' && swaymsg -t get_tree | jq -r '.. | select(.focused?) | .rect | "\(.x),\(.y) \(.width)x\(.height)"' | grim -t ppm -g - - | $tensaku

    bindsym Return mode "default"
    bindsym Escape mode "default"
}
bindsym $mod+Shift+p mode $printscreen_mode
```

## Hyprland integration: floating-window size rule

Tensaku sizes its own window around the captured image at startup, on
crop commit, and on revert. For that to work the window has to be
**floating** with **no hard-coded size rule**. The tiling layout
will otherwise stretch / squash the window to whatever the tile
gives it, and a `windowrule = size <X> <Y>` will pin it to that
size regardless of what Tensaku asks for — which shows up as the
image rendered shrunk inside a fixed-size window, and (with
animations on) as a visible width-bounce when you Super+drag the
window mid-flight while the size rule is re-asserted against the
drag.

Notably, **Omarchy ships with such a rule by default** via its
`floating-window` tag:

```hypr
# ~/.local/share/omarchy/default/hypr/apps/system.conf (default)
windowrule = float on,         match:tag floating-window
windowrule = center on,        match:tag floating-window
windowrule = size 875 600,     match:tag floating-window   # ← pins window size
windowrule = tag +floating-window, match:class (... dev.tensaku.Tensaku ...)
```

**`tensaku --wire-omarchy` sets this up for you** — it appends the float +
center rules (and the `tag -floating-window` untag) for
`dev.tensaku.Tensaku` to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` (backed up first,
and skipped if they're already present) and reloads Hyprland. To do it by
hand instead — or on another wlroots compositor — drop the tag for
`dev.tensaku.Tensaku` in your local `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` and
re-apply float + center directly:

```hypr
# Let Tensaku size its own window around the captured image.
windowrule = tag -floating-window, match:class dev.tensaku.Tensaku
windowrule = float on,             match:class dev.tensaku.Tensaku
windowrule = center on,            match:class dev.tensaku.Tensaku
```

Then `hyprctl reload`. The next screenshot will open at the right
size; if you previously added `windowrule = animation none` for the
drag-bounce workaround, you can remove it — the bounce was caused
by the size rule fighting the drag, not by the animation itself.

## Build from source

You first need to install the native dependencies of Tensaku (see below) and then run:

```sh
# build release binary, located in ./target/release/tensaku
make build-release

# optional: install to /usr/local
PREFIX=/usr/local make install

# optional: uninstall from /usr/local
PREFIX=/usr/local make uninstall
```

### Flatpak

Tensaku can be built as a Flatpak bundle, and a pre-built bundle is attached to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/jondkinney/tensaku/releases).

#### Installing from Flatpak bundle

```sh
# Download the .flatpak file from the latest release
# Then install it:
flatpak install tensaku-<version>.flatpak
```
